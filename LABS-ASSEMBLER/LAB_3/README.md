Hi.

Task:

1.Input an int massive the size of 30 elements

2.Find the number that repeats the most in the massive

3.Output this number

P.S. I've got a problem here to solve-i will don't get overflow entering 32768 or higher BUT according to the rules it is POSSIBLE to enter a number from 0 to -32768 BUT in my program I can't enter -32768

Have a good day :)
