Hi

These files were used by me to compile my code on ASSEMBLY language

To compile a .asm file you need to create a folder where you put all the files I uploaded

Using:

tasm lab_name.asm -> tlink lab_name.obj -> lab_name.exe

This should make it

Environment: DOSBox 0.74 ,TASM

Have a good day :)
