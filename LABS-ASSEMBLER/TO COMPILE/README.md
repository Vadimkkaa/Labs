Hi

These files were used by me to compile my code on ASSEMBLY language

To compile an .asm file you need to create a folder where you put all the files I uploaded

Using:

P.S In my labs I get an .exe file, if you need a .com file look below but keep in mind that my labs won't work without some refactoring) 

tasm lab_name.asm -> tlink lab_name.obj -> lab_name.exe 

P.P.S. this example is represented for making .exe files, if you need a .com file follow this order:

tasm lab_name.asm -> tlink /t lab_name.obj -> lab_name.com

If you want to use a debugger, just write a 'td' word before the  lab_name.exe file

This should make it

Environment: DOSBox 0.74, TASM

Have a good day :)
