Hi.

The task:

Create a dirwalk program, which can scan file system and print info into stdout according to options (aka keys)

Possible keys-

-l -- only symbolic links (- type l)

-d -- only directories (- type d)

-f -- only files (- type f)

-s -- sort.

If no options entered- output is all types (-s is optional)



P.S.  You can enter keys in any order, for instance-

a)./dirwalk -df -l

b)./dirwalk -ldf 

and etc.

Both options are working correctly

P.P.S  I recommend using this program in a directory with a lot of (files). By doing that you will get much more files/dir/links to look at and see how my program actually works

Have a good day :)
