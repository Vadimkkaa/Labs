Hi.

This repository represents labs wtitten on C-language for Linux system

One thing: At the moment of creating this file I have not currently installed Linux on my PC

So here comes the question- how do I do the task?

The answer is me using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) 

Have a good day :)
