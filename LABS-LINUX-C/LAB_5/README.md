Hi

Topic: Threads

Task:

Create a black-and-white picture out of the one(colourful) given as example(sample.bmp) using threads

Important:

I have 4 actual cores and 8 logical Processors

So I am using 8 threads to perform the task

Also, I need .bmp images to perform the task so it's important to convert them in the right way for using im my programm

At the moment of writing this I found useful this-> https://convertio.co/ru/  site to do it right

Have a good day :)
